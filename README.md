ðŸ§¬ About ðŸ§¬<br>
For my lunar lander game, I envisioned a whimsical and adventurous theme centered around a mischievous black cat named Pepper.

Pepper's favorite toy is a golden ball of yarn. One night, captivated by the moon's radiant glow, Pepper becomes enchanted by its shimmering presence.
To Pepper, the moon looks like a giant ball of yarn hanging in the sky, making it irresistible.
As it gazes up at the moon, an idea takes hold: it must leave Earth and reach the moon, where it can eternally play and sleep undisturbed by humans.

Driven by this dream, Pepper ingeniously constructs a spaceship. With its destination in sight, it embarks on its daring journey to space.
However, upon nearing the moon, Pepper discovers that landing is not as easy as it thought. It now seeks the player's help to safely land on the moon's surface.

In this game, the player assists Pepper in piloting its spaceship, guiding it to a safe landing on the moon so it can fulfill its dream
of endless play and rest under the moon's gentle light.
